# SOME POINT TO MAKE ELECTION MORE SECURE,RELIABLE AND TRANSPERENCY
WE HAVE SOME IDEA REGARDING THESE PROBLEMS''''
1.. IVOTING/ONLINE VOTING ..
WE know it might not be succesfull because of tecnical issue like hacking or netwrk problem etc. There are many people doesn't want to go to go to poll booth OR not able to do so it might be helpful. we can make an applicatio : where when votar open the application, it shoud be in VPN mode so that hacker would not hack it . it should be connected only with election commision department . every digital company should promote this application so that everyone can able to get it easily.
it is one of the reason to many people not able to participte in process of voting  because they are not live in electoral area. by the use of any aplication that make easy to vote at any places.That application as on must be connected to oficial site of election commision department. And find all the election related record. On the voting portal of application :
           Find the electoral area . eg. state-district-electoral area.
					 Find own name on voting namelist.
					 List of candidates and there election symbol.
					 Teach candidate in brief record of their social background , education and their working history.
					 Their important promises.
					 select the candidates to voting and click the symbol button.
By the security purpose in term of hacking ,if Any person cost their vote then vote are directly save to EC report.
After save the vote in EC record then recieve the confirmation messageor mail on their voter's mobile phone.
alert button of the application by the notification inform election date and time and all the election related important news.
2.. EVM HACKING .. FINGER PRINT BASED VOTING SYSTEM ..
WE have seen last few years about claiming 'evm hacking' by opposition parties. To make it secure ,reliable and transperency .one application installed device that is connected with EVM ,During voter click on the evm for voting the device get the data and send to election commision secure department with one way network . At the time of vote counting it should be transparent to every votars.
In term of security reasons and hacking , EVM are based on fingerprint sensor and fingerprint linked to ADHAR of every voters for varfication.
